# Building a DApp with Webpack
In this lecture we will start developing the frontend for our [ICO](Lecture 6 - build-your-own-ICO.md).
We will base the javascript frontend on the [Webpack box](https://github.com/truffle-box/webpack-box) provided by truffle. However, to make it work with our contracts we will modify the truffle box a little.

## Getting started
We are going to use the latest version of Webpack, which requires a reasonably modern version of Node. So start by updating your version of Node:
```bash
$ sudo npm cache clean -f
$ sudo npm install -g n
$ sudo n latest
```
Let's start by creating our own frontend project folder
```bash
$ mkdir jf-frontend
$ cd js-frontend
```
Now let's unbox the webpack example.
```bash
$ truffle unbox webpack
```
After a few seconds you should have the basic code. Now let's get rid of its original contracts and customize the code to run with our FunnyToken ICO contracts:
```bash
$ rm -rf contracts
$ rm -rf migrations
$ rm truffle.js 
$ rm test
```
Now we are left with just the frontend code. We will now edit the app code. Let's start by `app/scripts/index.js`
it should be edited to become like below:
```javascript
// Import the page's CSS. Webpack will know what to do with it.
import '../styles/app.css'

// Import libraries we need.
import {default as Web3} from 'web3'
import {default as contract} from 'truffle-contract'

// Import our contract artifacts and turn them into usable abstractions.
import funnyTokenArtifact from '../../../FunnyToken/build/contracts/FunnyToken.json'
import tokenSaleArtifact from '../../../FunnyToken/build/contracts/TokenSale'

// FunnyToken is our usable abstraction, which we'll use through the code below.
const FunnyToken = contract(funnyTokenArtifact)
const TokenSale = contract(tokenSaleArtifact)

// The following code is simple to show off interacting with your contracts.
// As your needs grow you will likely need to change its form and structure.
// For application bootstrapping, check out window.addEventListener below.
let accounts
let account

const App = {
    start: function () {
        const self = this

        // Bootstrap the FunnyToken abstraction for Use.
        FunnyToken.setProvider(web3.currentProvider)

        // Get the initial account balance so it can be displayed.
        web3.eth.getAccounts(function (err, accs) {
            if (err != null) {
                alert('There was an error fetching your accounts.')
                return
            }

            if (accs.length === 0) {
                alert("Couldn't get any accounts! Make sure your Ethereum client is configured correctly.")
                return
            }

            accounts = accs
            account = accounts[0]

            self.refreshBalance()
        })
    },

    setStatus: function (message) {
        const status = document.getElementById('status')
        status.innerHTML = message
    },

    refreshBalance: function () {
        const self = this

        let funny
        FunnyToken.deployed().then(function (instance) {
            funny = instance
            return funny.balanceOf.call(account, {from: account})
        }).then(function (value) {
            const balanceElement = document.getElementById('balance')
            balanceElement.innerHTML = value.valueOf()
        }).catch(function (e) {
            console.log(e)
            self.setStatus('Error getting balance; see log.')
        })
    },

    sendCoin: function () {
        const self = this

        const amount = parseInt(document.getElementById('amount').value)
        const receiver = document.getElementById('receiver').value

        this.setStatus('Initiating transaction... (please wait)')

        let funny
        FunnyToken.deployed().then(function (instance) {
            funny = instance
            return funny.sendCoin(receiver, amount, {from: account})
        }).then(function () {
            self.setStatus('Transaction complete!')
            self.refreshBalance()
        }).catch(function (e) {
            console.log(e)
            self.setStatus('Error sending coin; see log.')
        })
    }
}

window.App = App

window.addEventListener('load', function () {
    // Checking if Web3 has been injected by the browser (Mist/MetaMask)
    if (typeof web3 !== 'undefined') {
        console.warn(
            'Using web3 detected from external source.' +
            ' If you find that your accounts don\'t appear or you have 0 FunnyToken,' +
            ' ensure you\'ve configured that source properly.' +
            ' If using MetaMask, see the following link.' +
            ' Feel free to delete this warning. :)' +
            ' http://truffleframework.com/tutorials/truffle-and-metamask'
        )
        // Use Mist/MetaMask's provider
        window.web3 = new Web3(web3.currentProvider)
    } else {
        console.warn(
            'No web3 detected. Falling back to http://127.0.0.1:8545.' +
            ' You should remove this fallback when you deploy live, as it\'s inherently insecure.' +
            ' Consider switching to Metamask for development.' +
            ' More info here: http://truffleframework.com/tutorials/truffle-and-metamask'
        )
        // fallback - use your fallback strategy (local node / hosted node + in-dapp id mgmt / fail)
        window.web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider('http://127.0.0.1:8545'))
    }

    App.start()
})
```
We are still going to modify this file as we improve our DApp frontend. But for now, just code should do.
You will also need to modify `app/index.html` to look like this:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>FunnyToken - Join our Fun ICO!</title>
  <link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
  <script src="./app.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>FunnyToken</h1>
  <h2>The Funniest ICO Ever!</h2>
  <h3>You have <span class="black"><span id="balance"></span> Funny</span></h3>

  <br>
  <h1>Buy FunnyToken!</h1>
  <p>Send Ether to this Address:</p>
  <br><label for="amount">Amount:</label><input type="text" id="amount" placeholder="e.g., 95"></input>
  <br><label for="receiver">Your Address:</label><input type="text" id="receiver" placeholder="e.g., 0x93e66d9baea28c17d9fc393b53e3fbdd76899dae"></input>
  <br><br><button id="send" onclick="App.sendCoin()">Send FunnyToken</button>
  <br><br>
  <span id="status"></span>
  <br>
  <span class="hint"><strong>Hint:</strong> open the browser developer console to view any errors and warnings.</span>
</body>
</html>

```



Let's now compile and migrate the contracts of Our ICO. Make sure you have started either Ganache or `ganache-cli` and from inside the FunnyToken directory run:
```bash
$ truffle compile
$ truffle migrate
``` 
This should deploy the FunnyToken Contract.



## Running the frontend App
Now we can run our frontend code. From the `js-frontend` directory, run:
```bash
$ npm run dev
``` 
If everything goes well, point your browser to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see your app. 

## Supporting both Development, Testing and Production blockchains
One thing web developers learn very quickly is how to maintain different configurations for both the development and production environments. It is very important to maintain function configuration for the development environments even after we go into production with our web app because we will always need a safe environment in which to test new feature without the risk of breaking the public website.

In our ICO DApp project, we will have three environments to cater to: the development, the Testnet (Ropsten), and the Main Ethereum network (mainnet). On top of that, we have two environments for running the web app: local development machine and production server. That gives us 6 different configuration sets to maintain.

Regarding the Blockchain configurations, we need to configure our ethereum providers using web3, luckily it is not much different than what we've already done to connect to our local private blockchain.
